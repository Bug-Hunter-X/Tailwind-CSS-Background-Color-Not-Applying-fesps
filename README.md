# Tailwind CSS Background Color Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: the background color utility classes not working as expected.

## Problem

A simple div with a Tailwind CSS class for background color doesn't display the intended background.  This can happen due to various reasons like conflicting styles, incorrect class application, or missing dependencies.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for CSS specificity issues, ensuring correct class implementation, and inspecting the browser's developer tools for conflicting styles. The solution also shows how to fix this issue.  The main focus should be on CSS specificity and ensuring no other styles override the Tailwind class.
